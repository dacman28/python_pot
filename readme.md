# Python Pot 
==This is a work in progres==

The idea behind this project is to use Python listeners to simulate various applications.

This POC `resp_sharepoint_poc.py` will listen for GET requests and log them on what appears to be a SharePoint server. There is code later in the text that triggers actions on POST commands but those are not finished yet. 

To run naviagate to the directory where the script is located and run:
`python resp_sharepoint_poc.py`
